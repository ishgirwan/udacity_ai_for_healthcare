# AI for healthcare

The [Udaicty's AI for healthcare Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-for-healthcare-nanodegree--nd320) helps in learning skills to make clinical decisions using machine learning. My completion certificate of this program is [here](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/W7RQLZKX). In this program, I have learnt to:

* Recommend appropriate imaging modalities for common clinical applications of 2D medical imaging
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on 2D medical imaging data to inform model training and explain model performance       
* Establish the appropriate ‘ground truth’ methodologies for training algorithms to label medical images
* Extract images from a DICOM dataset
* Train common CNN architectures to classify 2D medical images
* Translate outputs of medical imaging models for use by a clinician 
* Plan necessary validations to prepare a medical imaging model for regulatory approval       
* Detect major clinical abnormalities in a DICOM dataset
* Train machine learning models for classification tasks using real-world 3D medical imaging data
* Integrate models into a clinician’s workflow and troubleshoot deployments 
* Build machine learning models in a manner that is compliant with U.S. healthcare data security and privacy standards
* Use the TensorFlow Dataset API to scalably extract, transform, and load datasets that are aggregated at the line, encounter, and longitudinal (patient) data levels       
* Analyze EHR datasets to check for common issues (data leakage, statistical properties, missing values, high cardinality) by performing exploratory data analysis with TensorFlow Data Analysis and Validation library       
* Create categorical features from Key Industry Code Sets (ICD, CPT, NDC) and reduce dimensionality for high cardinality features
* Use TensorFlow feature columns on both continuous and categorical input features to create derived features (bucketing, cross-features, embeddings) 
* Use Shapley values to select features for a model and identify the marginal contribution for each selected feature
* Analyze and determine biases for a model for key demographic groups
* Use the TensorFlow Probability library to train a model that provides uncertainty range predictions in  order to allow for risk adjustment/prioritization and triaging of predictions
* Preprocess data (eliminate “noise”) collected by IMU, PPG, and ECG sensors based on mechanical,  physiology and environmental effects on the signal.       
* Create an activity classification algorithm using signal processing and machine learning techniques
* Detect QRS complexes using one-dimensional time series processing techniques
* Evaluate algorithm performance without ground truth labels
* Generate a pulse rate algorithm that combines information from the PPG and IMU sensor streams
